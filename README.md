## Getting started

For this assignment you'll make a new project and repository.

1. Navigate to the folder where you keep your General Assembly projects (e.g. `~/Desktop/ga/projects`)
2. Create a new folder for your project (`mkdir html-layout`)
3. Change directories into your new project folder (`cd html-layout`)
4. Initialize your new git repository (`git init`)
5. Create a new html file (`touch index.html`)
6. Stage and commit your new file to the repository (*refer to the workflow from yesterday if you need a refresher!*)
7. Setup a repository on GitHub for this project (*like you did yesterday*)
8. Ensure to follow the instructions provided to sync the GitHub repository with the one on your local computer
9. Finally, open the project in VS Code from the Terminal (`code .`)
10. Open the `index.html` file by double clicking it


## Instructions

The goal of this assignment is to use HTML to create a semantic layout that represents the layout that you see at http://alistapart.com/.

It's important to remember that the purpose of HTML is to describe the content and structure of our document, not how it looks. If you open this document in the browser when you're finished it won't be pretty, but the hierarchy of the information should look similar to what you see on A List Apart.

**Ensure that you commit often as you add more markup to your document!**

There's more than one possible solution to this, so work together with your team mates to compare answers and work toward a layout that best represents the layout and content on that homepage.


## Submit your assignment

When you're done playing around with this document, submit the link to your repository on the submissions tab above.
